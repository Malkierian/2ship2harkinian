     * Normally, the Oceanside Spider House squatter appears at the entrance once the player has acquired the 30
     * Skulltula tokens. Mikau's grave on Great Bay Coast, for some reason, sets the flag for the squatter to move in
     * and sit in the inner area. If Link has not spoken to him before this point, his reward will be unavailable for
     * the remainder of the cycle. This fix changes it so that this will not happen until the player speaks to the
     * squatter. This is forced on for rando, as there is a good chance the player will find the 30th token outside of
     * the Oceanside Spider House, meaning the player would have to cross Great Bay Coast to find the man, which would
     * render the check unobtainable.
